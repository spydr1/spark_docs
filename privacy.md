We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

**8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?**

***In Short:*** *We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.*

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than twelve (12) months past the start of the idle period of the user's account.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**

***In Short:*** *We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures, leveraging trusted third-party services like Google Firebase.*

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. To achieve this, we leverage industry-leading services, including **Google Firebase**, for our backend infrastructure. By utilizing Google's robust security architecture, we benefit from their expertise and advanced technologies designed to safeguard your data.

However, despite our safeguards and the advanced measures taken by our partners, it is important to remember that no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. While we and our partners are committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot promise or guarantee infallible security. Therefore, any transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

**10. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Our Services are not intended for or directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. In alignment with our service policy, we target users who are 16 years of age or older. **Regardless of parental consent, individuals under the age of 16 are not permitted to create an account or use our Services.**

If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 16 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at jcompany.develop@gmail.com.

**11. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER**

Your information, including personal information, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.

Specifically, we utilize service providers, such as Google LLC, which are located in the United States. As a result, your personal information is transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States to facilitate the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including data storage, system operation, analytics, payment processing, AI chat functionality, and serving personalized advertising. This transfer occurs via encrypted transmission over a secure network when you use our Services.

If you are located outside the United States and choose to use our Services, you consent to this transfer, storage, and processing of your information in the United States. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

**12. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

***In Short:*** *You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.*

**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

**Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising on Mobile Devices**
**You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of interest-based advertising by accessing the settings on your mobile device.**
*   **For Android:** **Open the Settings app > Go to "Privacy" > Select "Ads" > Tap "Delete advertising ID."**
**Please note that the exact path may vary depending on your device and operating system version.**

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
*   Log in to your account settings and update your user account.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and personal information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files for a legally permissible period to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms, and/or comply with legal and regulatory requirements (such as for tax, legal, and accounting purposes).

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at jcompany.develop@gmail.com.

**13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online Browse activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
