The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services.

## 30.  RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND DISCLAIMERS FOR AI-GENERATED CONTENT

1. **Ownership and Evolving Law:** To the extent permitted by applicable law, you own the content you create using the Service, including your inputs and the resulting output ("AI-Generated Content"). You acknowledge that the legal framework governing copyright for AI-generated content is new and evolving. The ownership principles stated herein are subject to change in accordance with future legislative and judicial developments, and we do not guarantee ownership rights will remain unchanged. 
2.  **License to Us:** To operate and provide the Service, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, display, process, and provide this content. 
3. **Disclaimer of Accuracy and Appropriateness:** The AI may occasionally produce content that is inaccurate, offensive, sexual, or otherwise inappropriate. You understand and agree that any such content does not represent the official position or views of the Company. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or safety of any AI-Generated Content. 
4. **Disclaimer of Third-Party Rights Infringement:** We do not warrant that the AI-Generated Content will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights (such as copyrights or trademarks) of a third party. You are solely responsible for ensuring your use of the content does not violate any third-party rights. 
5. **Your Responsibility:** You agree to use the AI-Generated Content at your own risk. You are solely responsible for your use of the content, including compliance with all applicable laws. We will not be liable for any claims or damages arising from your use of it.

6.  **No Professional Advice:**  The AI-Generated Content is for informational and entertainment purposes only and is not a substitute for professional advice from a qualified provider. The AI is not a licensed doctor, lawyer, financial advisor, or any other certified professional. You must not rely on the AI for medical, legal, financial, or any other professional advice. Any action you take based on the AI-Generated Content is strictly at your own risk, and we disclaim all liability for any damages or losses arising from your reliance on such content.

  

## 31.  POLICY ON IN-APP CURRENCY ('SPARKS')

Our Service includes a virtual currency known as 'sparks' (âœ¨), which are used exclusively to interact with the AI characters within the Service. The following terms apply to 'sparks': 
1. **Nature of License:** 'Sparks' constitute a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use specific features of our Service. They have no monetary or real-world value and cannot be exchanged for real money. 
2. **Account Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for maintaining access to the Google account linked to your Service profile. We are not responsible for, and will not provide refunds or restore 'sparks' for, any loss of 'sparks' resulting from your inability to access your Google account. 
3. **Expiration:** Unless otherwise specified at the time of purchase, purchased 'sparks' will expire and be removed from your account if not used within **one (1) year** from the date of purchase. No compensation will be provided for expired 'sparks'. 
4. **Revocation Rights:** We reserve the right to revoke or remove 'sparks' from your account without a refund if we determine, in our sole discretion, that they were obtained or used through any fraudulent activity, bug, system error, or violation of these Terms. 
5.  **Refund and Consumption Policy:** 'Sparks' are non-refundable (unless required by law). A 'spark' is considered consumed each time you submit a prompt, even if the AI refuses to generate a response due to safety policy violations. When processing a legally required refund for a partially used 'spark' package purchased at a discount, the refund amount will be calculated based on the non-discounted, standard price of the 'sparks' you have consumed. Any applicable payment processing fees may also be deducted.

  

## 32.  SERVICE AVAILABILITY, MODIFICATIONS, AND TERMINATION

We strive to keep the Service operational but do not guarantee that it will be available 24/7 or be free from errors. The Service is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. 1. **Suspension and Interruption:** We reserve the right to suspend or interrupt the Service, in whole or in part, for any reason, including for maintenance, repairs, system failures, or other operational necessities. Where possible, we will try to provide advance notice of any planned interruptions, but we are not obligated to do so. 2. **Third-Party Dependencies:** You acknowledge that the Service's availability and functionality are dependent on third-party services, including but not limited to Google (e.g., Firebase, Google Cloud, Gemini API). We are not responsible or liable for any service interruptions, failures, data loss, or other issues caused by the acts or omissions of these third-party providers. 3. **Modifications:** We reserve the right to modify the Service, or any part of it, at any time. This includes the right to change the features available or the value and consumption rate of 'sparks'. 4. **Termination:** In the event of a permanent termination of the Service, we will provide at least thirty (30) days' notice. We will also provide instructions on how to claim a refund for any unused, paid-for 'sparks'. Refunds will not be provided for 'sparks' obtained for free.
